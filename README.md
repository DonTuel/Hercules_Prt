<h4 align="left">Notes</h4>

<p>
This is still a work in progress. It has been tested with TK4. It works well enough for my uses.
<br><br>
It has some minimal testing code in for anyone interested in making changes.
<br><br>
There are various improvements that I can think of. I will update this as time permits. But for now ...
